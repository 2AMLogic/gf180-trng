## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/run_corners.py sampler-dff-reset-current-xsb --corners ff --temps 125 --supply 2.97 --supply-tol 0 --no-write
```

## Caveats

- Single corner (ff / 2.97 V / 125 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- Run concurrently (-j 3); wall_time is the SUMMED per-run ngspice cost for this point, not elapsed time, and is inflated relative to a quiet machine by contention between concurrent runs.
- DUT is the schematic-derived netlist sampler_core.spice; netlist.sha above is that file's blob SHA, and `python3 design/netlist.py --check` is what ties it to the schematic it claims to come from.
- D is an ideal 500 ps (2 GHz) square wave, not the real ro_array_core -- deliberately, so this record does not conflate the reset-window conduction mechanism's PVT dependence with the ring's own frequency PVT dependence. See the testbench header for why the pre-#53 result should not depend on the chosen frequency.
- Models the WORST-CASE phase relationship (clk held at 0 for the whole window), not any specific power-on sequence -- how long reset is actually asserted, and at what clk phase, is a system-level timing question #26 owns, not measured here.
- What this current IS depends on which cell the record ran against, and the record's netlist.sha says which. Pre-#53 (a reset pulldown on node m): deliberate resistive contention between two simultaneously-ON pass devices, which must NOT be compared against sim/tb/device-leakage-03v3/ or sim/tb/ro-inv-05stage-stopped-leakage/ as if it were the same phenomenon. Post-#53 (reset gated into the latches' inverters, no device on a storage node): that path does not exist and what is left is nanoamp-scale.
- i_reset_xsb_first_a vs i_reset_xsb_last_a is a start-up/frequency-dependence check only while the measured total is large compared with the charge integrator's numerical residue. On the post-#53 cell it is not -- the two halves differ by a large fraction of a very small number, and that ratio carries no physical meaning.
- The 50% duty cycle assumed by driving D symmetrically is representative, not measured from xo -- xo's own duty cycle (rise/fall symmetry of the XOR node) is not characterized by this testbench or any other in this repository.
- D's driving current is idealized as a zero-impedance source powered from the same vdd rail (fq/fqd both integrate into the same charge node -- see the testbench header): a real xor2 output stage has finite ON resistance, which this record does not include.
- clk is held at 0 for the whole window, so this says nothing about what a clk EDGE does while reset is asserted. Post-#53 that is the case the cell's reset structure turns on (see design/xschem/sampler_dff.sch's header); it is not measured by this testbench.
