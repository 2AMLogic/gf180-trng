## Result

Well-tied extracted netlist (PMOS bodies rewired to `vddr`), this record:

- `period_s`: 8.129690e-09
- `supply_current_avg_a`: -3.209810e-05
- `ro_swing_v`: 3.54912

Same corner, not re-simulated here, from the committed envelope `signoff/evidence/post-layout/ro_ring11.pex.json` (klt pex 0.6.0, schematic DUT and extracted netlist with floating wells):

| row | schematic | extracted, wells floating | extracted, wells tied (this record) | floating vs schematic | tied vs schematic | tied vs floating |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `period_s` | 3.852930e-09 | 7.200470e-09 | 8.129690e-09 | +86.9 % | +111.0 % | +12.9 % |
| `supply_current_avg_a` | -3.679750e-05 | -3.289350e-05 | -3.209810e-05 | -10.6 % | -12.8 % | -2.4 % |
| `ro_swing_v` | 3.7391 | 3.52028 | 3.54912 | -5.9 % | -5.1 % | +0.8 % |

Numbers only. No spec-compliance claim is made by this record.

## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/tb/ro-ring11-pex-welltied/build_welltied.py --check
uvx --from "klayout-tools==0.6.0" klt sim --backend batch -o /tmp/welltied \
    sim/tb/ro-ring11-pex-welltied/request.json --format json > /tmp/welltied/report.json
```

This record is the `ff/3.630V/-40C` entry of that 27-corner request (batch job `klt-sim-aabfb69c043d`).
A single corner can be run locally by narrowing `corners` in a copy of the request.

## Caveats

- Single corner (ff / 3.63 V / -40 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- The netlist is the extraction of `layout/rings/ro_ring11/ro_ring11.gds` (`signoff/evidence/post-layout/ro_ring11.extracted.spice`) with the body (4th terminal) of all 23 PMOS rewired from their 11 anonymous floating well nets to the `vddr` port node, by `build_welltied.py`, derived from the envelope's `body_bias` block. It is a counterfactual, NOT a drawn-layout result: the layout draws no n-well tie (layout/README.md), so no drawn cell has this connection. The tie is ideal (no access resistance), the best case for a tie.
- The schematic side of the comparison ties PMOS bulk to `vddr`; the floating side is the committed envelope.
- Ring1 only. Ring2, the buffers, the XOR combiner, the samplers and every inter-region net are not included.
- Parasitics captured are what `klt extract --parasitics` models for ring1 alone: device-level parasitics and the hand-routed inter-stage chain and rail straps; quasi-static lumped RC, no lateral coupling except named critical nets, no inter-region routing. See sim/characterization-post-layout-extracted.md section 7 and signoff/README.md.
- Noiseless, deterministic transient; no device mismatch; `ro` unloaded. Absolute periods differ from array-level records.
- Simulated on the batch fleet runner (ngspice-46); the figures also agree with a local single-corner probe at tt / 3.30 V / 27 C (13.65 ns). The floating/schematic figures come from the committed envelope's own run, not this job.
- The deck is self-contained: the batch backend of klt 0.6.0 uploads the testbench alone, so the netlist text is inlined into `tb_ro_ring11_pex_welltied.sp` (the separate netlist file is what `netlist.path` cites; `build_welltied.py --check` ties them).
