## Result

- `i_reset_xsv_a`: 2.206087e-04
- `p_reset_xsv_w`: 6.552077e-04
- `v_q`: 1.300911e-08
- `v_m`: 0.851251
- `v_rst`: 2.97

Numbers only. No entropy-rate or spec-compliance claim is made by this record.

## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/run_corners.py sampler-dff-reset-current-xsv --corners ff --temps -40 --supply 2.97 --supply-tol 0 --no-write
```

## Caveats

- Single corner (ff / 2.97 V / -40 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- Run concurrently (-j 4); wall_time is the SUMMED per-run ngspice cost for this point, not elapsed time, and is inflated relative to a quiet machine by contention between concurrent runs.
- DUT is the schematic-derived netlist sampler_core.spice; netlist.sha above is that file's blob SHA, and `python3 design/netlist.py --check` is what ties it to the schematic it claims to come from.
- Models the WORST-CASE phase relationship (clk held at 0 for the whole reset assertion), not any specific power-on sequence -- how long reset is actually asserted, and at what clk phase, is a system-level timing question #26 owns, not measured here.
- This is deliberate resistive contention between two simultaneously-ON pass devices, not subthreshold/junction leakage -- do not compare this current directly against sim/tb/device-leakage-03v3/ or sim/tb/ro-inv-05stage-stopped-leakage/ figures as if they were the same phenomenon.
- xsv's D is wired directly to vdd in design/sampler_core.spice, so this DC bias is exactly xsv's real condition during a clk-low, reset-asserted interval -- not an approximation of it.
