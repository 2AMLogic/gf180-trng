Numbers only. No entropy-rate or spec-compliance claim is made by this record.

## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/run_corners.py sampler-dff-reset-current-xsv --corners ff --temps 125 --supply 3.3 --supply-tol 0 --no-write
```

## Caveats

- Single corner (ff / 3.30 V / 125 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- Run concurrently (-j 3); wall_time is the SUMMED per-run ngspice cost for this point, not elapsed time, and is inflated relative to a quiet machine by contention between concurrent runs.
- DUT is the schematic-derived netlist sampler_core.spice; netlist.sha above is that file's blob SHA, and `python3 design/netlist.py --check` is what ties it to the schematic it claims to come from.
- Models the WORST-CASE phase relationship (clk held at 0 for the whole reset assertion), not any specific power-on sequence -- how long reset is actually asserted, and at what clk phase, is a system-level timing question #26 owns, not measured here.
- What this current IS depends on which cell the record ran against, and the record's netlist.sha says which. Pre-#53 (a reset pulldown on node m): deliberate resistive contention between two simultaneously-ON pass devices, which must NOT be compared against sim/tb/device-leakage-03v3/ or sim/tb/ro-inv-05stage-stopped-leakage/ as if it were the same phenomenon. Post-#53 (reset gated into the latches' inverters, no device on a storage node): that path does not exist and what is left is ordinary off-device leakage at this bias.
- xsv's D is wired directly to vdd in design/sampler_core.spice, so this DC bias is exactly xsv's real condition during a clk-low, reset-asserted interval -- not an approximation of it.
- A DC operating point says nothing about what happens at a clk EDGE while reset is asserted. Post-#53 that is the case the cell's reset structure turns on (see design/xschem/sampler_dff.sch's header); it is not measured by this testbench.
