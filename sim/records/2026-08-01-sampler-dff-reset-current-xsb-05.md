## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/run_corners.py sampler-dff-reset-current-xsb --corners tt --temps 27 --supply 3.3 --supply-tol 0 --no-write
```

## Caveats

- Single corner (tt / 3.30 V / 27 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- Run concurrently (-j 4); wall_time is the SUMMED per-run ngspice cost for this point, not elapsed time, and is inflated relative to a quiet machine by contention between concurrent runs.
- DUT is the schematic-derived netlist sampler_core.spice; netlist.sha above is that file's blob SHA, and `python3 design/netlist.py --check` is what ties it to the schematic it claims to come from.
- D is an ideal 500 ps (2 GHz) square wave, not the real ro_array_core -- deliberately, so this record does not conflate the reset-window conduction mechanism's PVT dependence with the ring's own frequency PVT dependence. See the testbench header for why the result should not depend on the chosen frequency (checked via i_reset_xsb_first_a vs i_reset_xsb_last_a, not assumed).
- Models the WORST-CASE phase relationship (clk held at 0 for the whole window), not any specific power-on sequence -- how long reset is actually asserted, and at what clk phase, is a system-level timing question #26 owns, not measured here.
- This is deliberate resistive contention between two simultaneously-ON pass devices, not subthreshold/junction leakage -- do not compare this current directly against sim/tb/device-leakage-03v3/ or sim/tb/ro-inv-05stage-stopped-leakage/ figures as if they were the same phenomenon.
- The 50% duty cycle assumed by driving D symmetrically is representative, not measured from xo -- xo's own duty cycle (rise/fall symmetry of the XOR node) is not characterized by this testbench or any other in this repository.
- D's driving current is idealized as a zero-impedance source powered from the same vdd rail (fq/fqd both integrate into the same charge node -- see the testbench header): a real xor2 output stage has finite ON resistance, which this record does not include.
