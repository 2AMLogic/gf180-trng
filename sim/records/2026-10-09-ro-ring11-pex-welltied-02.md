## Result

Well-tied extracted netlist (PMOS bodies rewired to `vddr`), this record:

- `period_s`: 1.563750e-08
- `supply_current_avg_a`: -1.274090e-05
- `ro_swing_v`: 2.93739

Same corner, not re-simulated here, from the committed envelope `signoff/evidence/post-layout/ro_ring11.pex.json` (klt pex 0.6.0, schematic DUT and extracted netlist with floating wells):

| row | schematic | extracted, wells floating | extracted, wells tied (this record) | floating vs schematic | tied vs schematic | tied vs floating |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `period_s` | 7.230730e-09 | 1.369360e-08 | 1.563750e-08 | +89.4 % | +116.3 % | +14.2 % |
| `supply_current_avg_a` | -1.468290e-05 | -1.324540e-05 | -1.274090e-05 | -9.8 % | -13.2 % | -3.8 % |
| `ro_swing_v` | 3.09576 | 2.91758 | 2.93739 | -5.8 % | -5.1 % | +0.7 % |

Numbers only. No spec-compliance claim is made by this record.

## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/tb/ro-ring11-pex-welltied/build_welltied.py --check
uvx --from "klayout-tools==0.6.0" klt sim --backend batch -o /tmp/welltied \
    sim/tb/ro-ring11-pex-welltied/request.json --format json > /tmp/welltied/report.json
```

This record is the `tt/2.970V/27C` entry of that 27-corner request (batch job `klt-sim-aabfb69c043d`).
A single corner can be run locally by narrowing `corners` in a copy of the request.

## Caveats

- Single corner (tt / 2.97 V / 27 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- The netlist is the extraction of `layout/rings/ro_ring11/ro_ring11.gds` (`signoff/evidence/post-layout/ro_ring11.extracted.spice`) with the body (4th terminal) of all 23 PMOS rewired from their 11 anonymous floating well nets to the `vddr` port node, by `build_welltied.py`, derived from the envelope's `body_bias` block. It is a counterfactual, NOT a drawn-layout result: the layout draws no n-well tie (layout/README.md), so no drawn cell has this connection. The tie is ideal (no access resistance), the best case for a tie.
- The schematic side of the comparison ties PMOS bulk to `vddr`; the floating side is the committed envelope.
- Ring1 only. Ring2, the buffers, the XOR combiner, the samplers and every inter-region net are not included.
- Parasitics captured are what `klt extract --parasitics` models for ring1 alone: device-level parasitics and the hand-routed inter-stage chain and rail straps; quasi-static lumped RC, no lateral coupling except named critical nets, no inter-region routing. See sim/characterization-post-layout-extracted.md section 7 and signoff/README.md.
- Noiseless, deterministic transient; no device mismatch; `ro` unloaded. Absolute periods differ from array-level records.
- Simulated on the batch fleet runner (ngspice-46); the figures also agree with a local single-corner probe at tt / 3.30 V / 27 C (13.65 ns). The floating/schematic figures come from the committed envelope's own run, not this job.
- The deck is self-contained: the batch backend of klt 0.6.0 uploads the testbench alone, so the netlist text is inlined into `tb_ro_ring11_pex_welltied.sp` (the separate netlist file is what `netlist.path` cites; `build_welltied.py --check` ties them).
