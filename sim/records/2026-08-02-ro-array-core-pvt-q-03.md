## How to reproduce

```sh
python3 sim/run_corners.py ro-array-core-pvt-q --corners tt --temps -40 --supply 3.63 --supply-tol 0 --no-write
```

## Caveats

- Single corner (tt / 3.63 V / -40 C). Says nothing about any other corner.
- Run concurrently (-j 5); wall_time is the SUMMED per-run ngspice cost for this point, not elapsed time, and is inflated relative to a quiet machine by contention between concurrent runs.
- DUT is the schematic-derived netlist ro_array_core.spice; netlist.sha above is that file's blob SHA, and `python3 design/netlist.py --check` is what ties it to the schematic it claims to come from.
- fs/sf process corners are NOT covered, per DR-0006's ratified reduced process axis. Every minimum/maximum this record family supports is a minimum/maximum over {tt, ff, ss} only, and does not extend to fs/sf.
- The 5 ps print step also caps ngspice's own solver step (SPICE3 defaults tmax to min(tstep, (tstop-tstart)/50)), which is 5x looser than the 1 ps of sim/tb/ro-array-core-power/. It is the reason a 6x longer window costs the same per point. The two families overlap at three PVT points (tt/27/3.30, ff/-40/3.63, ss/-40/3.63) and sim/tools/worst_corner_entropy.py reports the resulting per-quantity agreement; that comparison, not an assertion, is what justifies reading records from both families as the same measurement.
- Deterministic (mismatch-free, noiseless) transient: one nominal device draw per PVT point. Device mismatch is sim/tb/ro-array-core-mc-freq/'s subject and jitter is sim/tb/ro-ring5-starved-jitter-long/'s; nothing here measures either.
- The swing window (200-295 ns) and the 2nd-to-6th rising-edge measurement window are fixed in simulated time, not in ring periods, so they cover a different NUMBER of periods at fast and slow corners. That is deliberate -- period and integrated charge are both read between like edges an exact integer number of periods apart, so neither depends on how many periods the window happens to span -- but the swing figures are max/min over a fixed 95 ns window and therefore over more periods at fast corners than slow ones.
