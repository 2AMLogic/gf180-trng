# gf180-trng

A true random number generator on **gf180mcu**, GlobalFoundries' open PDK,
designed end to end by AI agents driving an entirely open-source analog flow:
xschem for schematics, ngspice for simulation, and
[klayout-tools](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools) for layout.

**Status: early. Nothing here has been fabricated, and nothing here has been
measured on silicon.** As of this writing the repository contains an evidence-record
convention, four proposed decision records, an entropy-source architecture
survey, and a working PVT corner simulation harness with its first
device-characterization results. There is no schematic in `design/` yet and no
GDS in `layout/`. The specification table below is a **draft** the design has
not yet been held to.

## Why this repo exists

Two reasons, and the second is why it is public.

**It is a real design.** A TRNG is a good first block for an open-PDK flow: it
is small, it is analog where it matters, and its central claim — that the bits
are actually random — cannot be hand-waved. It has to be simulated across
process, voltage and temperature, and eventually measured.

**It is a forcing function for the tools.** Every time the open-source flow is
awkward, missing a capability, or wrong for the job, that friction gets filed
as an issue against [klayout-tools](https://github.com/2AMLogic/klayout-tools)
rather than worked around silently. A block that is actually being built finds
tool gaps that a test case never will. Those issues are public, and they are
part of the point.

## Built by agents

This repository is developed autonomously. Issues are triaged, specified,
implemented, reviewed and merged by AI agents orchestrated with
[Loom](https://github.com/rjwalters/loom); the commit history, the decision
records, and the simulation evidence are all agent-authored. That is not a
disclaimer — it is the thesis being tested. The interesting question is not
whether an agent can write a netlist, it is whether an agent-run project can
hold itself to an engineering standard of evidence over hundreds of commits.

So the standard is enforced by structure rather than by supervision:

- **No claim without a testbench.** Every recorded number comes from a
  simulation that can be re-run.
- **Every result carries its corner.** Process, voltage and temperature on
  every record — no nominal-only results.
- **Evidence is append-only.** A re-run is a new record, never an edit to an
  old one. A stochastic result without its seeds is not evidence.
- **Spec changes go through a decision record**, so that "the spec moved" is
  always visible as a deliberate act rather than a quiet convenience.

If the structure works, it should be legible from the outside. If it does not,
that should be legible too.

## Target specification (DRAFT — not yet ratified, see issue #1)

| Parameter | Target | Stretch |
|---|---|---|
| Entropy source | ring-oscillator jitter | metastability hybrid |
| Raw rate | > 1 Mbps sustained at the raw tap (sampler output), binding at the slowest-RO corner: `ss` / −10 % / +125 °C ([DR-0003]) | > 4 Mbps, same definition |
| Quality | designed-for-SP 800-90B (raw access + RCT/APT + entropy-source model), plus a **simulation-derived design-stage min-entropy estimate** within the #10 claim limits; 90B validation itself deferred to measured silicon ([DR-0004]) | AIS-31 PTG.2 — same three-tier treatment (structure now, conformance deferred) |
| Health tests | continuous RCT + APT on the **raw** stream, α = 2⁻⁴⁰, APT window W = 1024, cutoffs as formulas in min-entropy H (draft H₀ = 0.5 → `C_RCT` = 81, `C_APT` = 824); failure latches a flag and gates the conditioned path until explicit clear + start-up test ([DR-0002]) | — |
| Power | < 500 µW active, < 1 µA idle | — |
| Area | < 0.05 mm² | — |
| Interface | streaming, mode-selectable raw / conditioned (`OUT_MODE`), + register read (`DATA` conditioned, `RAW_DATA` raw); raw access always available and never gated ([DR-0001]) | — |

> **Rows carrying a DR reference are *proposed* clarifications.** All four
> decision records are status `Proposed` and are ratified together with this
> table in #1; the table stays DRAFT until then. Note the two rows bind at
> **opposite** corners — rate at the slowest-RO corner, min-entropy per bit at
> the fast/high-V/cold corner (see #13) — and neither at nominal.

Maturity ladder: simulation-complete → layout DRC/LVS-clean → shuttle
seat → measured silicon over temperature. **The block is on the first rung.**
The SP 800-90B validation claim attaches to the last rung, not the first
([DR-0004]) — a simulated min-entropy estimate is not an entropy assessment,
and this repository will not let one be read as the other.

## Layout

```
spec/          spec + decision records
design/        schematics / netlists (xschem)                 — empty
sim/           testbenches + PVT corner results (ngspice)
layout/        GDS + DRC/LVS reports (klayout-tools driven)   — empty
measurements/  silicon characterization                       — empty until tape-out
```

Two conventions govern what lands in those directories:

- **[`sim/README.md`](sim/README.md)** — the append-only evidence record
  format. Every recorded simulation result carries its testbench/netlist
  identity, ngspice version, P/V/T corner, and seeds; re-runs are new
  records, never edits. A transient-noise result without its seeds is not
  evidence.
- **[`spec/decision-records/TEMPLATE.md`](spec/decision-records/TEMPLATE.md)**
  — the numbered decision-record template (`DR-0001-<slug>.md`). Spec
  changes go through a decision record.

### `sim/` harness

The PVT corner runner is a stdlib-only Python CLI. It emits into this repo's
`sim/README.md` evidence-record format — one record per PVT point — as
reconciled in
[`DR-0005`](spec/decision-records/DR-0005-sim-harness-record-granularity.md).

You will need the gf180mcu PDK (via
[open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks) or the
[IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS) container) and
ngspice 46 or newer. Nothing else — the harness is stdlib-only Python 3.

```sh
# One-time PDK check (no hardcoded paths -- see sim/harness/pdk.py for the
# GF180_PDK_PATH / PDK_ROOT+PDK / sim/pdk.local.json / sim/pdk.json /
# built-in-search-root resolution chain).
python3 sim/run_corners.py --check-env

# List testbenches (sim/tb/<slug>/tb.json) and available corners/corner-sets.
python3 sim/run_corners.py --list

# Run a testbench across a PVT grid -- one evidence record per grid point,
# written under sim/records/, per sim/README.md. No manual netlist edits.
python3 sim/run_corners.py <testbench-slug> --corner-set mos

# Harness acceptance test: unit tests + env check + smoke run + the
# corner-sanity guardrail (does switching process corner actually move
# device behavior, or is a corner file being silently ignored?).
sim/selftest.sh                # no evidence written
sim/selftest.sh --record       # also mints real records under sim/records/
```

Bootstrap testbenches under `sim/tb/` exercise the harness itself (not yet
the TRNG design, which has no `design/` content as of this bootstrap):
`smoke-op` (trivial op-point smoke test), `corner-sanity-nfet-id` (the
automated guardrail behind `sim/tools/corner_sanity_check.py`), and
`nfet-mismatch-seed` (demonstrates per-run seed control and exact
reproducibility for stochastic analyses — see `sim/README.md`'s "no seed,
no evidence" rule).
