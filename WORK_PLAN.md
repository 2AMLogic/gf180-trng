# Work Plan

Snapshot of the GitHub label state. Operator priority does not override a
dependency block or an operator-only decision.

## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs stuck under a `loom:operator` merge-risk hold — implementation work is done, only a human merge decision is missing.

- **#433**: Give the strict record-checksum CI step an npm check entry and parity coverage

## Operator Priority

Issues the operator starred (`loom:operator-priority`); land these first.

_None._

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

- **#339**: Post-layout re-sims run on floating PMOS wells; quantify against a well-tied extracted netlist

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

- **#418**: Verify assembled combiner/sampler reset and capture with native post-layout comparison
- **#449**: Digital tap spacing exceeds DRM 14.3.1 MV latch-up limit (49.7 um vs 15 um): confirm and decide
- **#463**: Reconcile shipped liveness samplers with the whole-block active-power ledger
- **#464**: Quantify DC voltage loss through the digital supply docking path and parallel PDN

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

_None._

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

- **#433**: Give the strict record-checksum CI step an npm check entry and parity coverage

## Proposed

Issues carrying `loom:curated`.

- **#339**: Post-layout re-sims run on floating PMOS wells; quantify against a well-tied extracted netlist *(curated)*
- **#418**: Verify assembled combiner/sampler reset and capture with native post-layout comparison *(curated)*
- **#432**: Give the strict record-checksum CI step an npm check entry and parity coverage *(curated)*
- **#449**: Digital tap spacing exceeds DRM 14.3.1 MV latch-up limit (49.7 um vs 15 um): confirm and decide *(curated)*

## Proposed (Architect / Hermit)

- **#467**: Characterize behavior just outside the operating envelope: the 'health-test-detected' clause has no testbench *(architect)*
- **#468**: Disambiguate the colliding DR-0011/DR-0012 citations (README links the wrong DR-0012) and guard them *(architect)*
- **#346**: Collapse duplicated ring1/ring2 layout generators (ro_nand2, ro_ring11) onto shared code *(hermit)*
