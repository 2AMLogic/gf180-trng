# Work Plan

Snapshot of the GitHub label state. Operator priority does not override a
dependency block or an operator-only decision.

## Operator Attention: Merge-Risk-Hold Pileup

Judge-approved PRs under a hold (`loom:blocked` or `loom:operator`) — only a human merge decision is missing.

_None._

## Very Important

`loom:very-important` (one counts per workspace); every stage takes these first.

_None._

## Important

`loom:important`; taken before unlabelled work.

- **#339**: Post-layout re-sims run on floating PMOS wells; quantify against a well-tied extracted netlist

## Ready

Human-approved issues ready for implementation (`loom:issue`).

- **#339**: Post-layout re-sims run on floating PMOS wells; quantify against a well-tied extracted netlist
- **#717**: Digital tapcell pitch: configure in build.py, re-place, and re-measure tap distance (LU.3/LU.4 placement unit of #487)

## In Progress

Issues currently being built (`loom:building`).

- **#520**: Replace ad-hoc sys.path.insert bootstraps with one import convention and a lint guard
- **#846**: Remove broken worktree:return npm script: its target script no longer exists

## PRs Awaiting Review

PRs waiting on Judge (`loom:review-requested`).

- **#849**: chore: drop package.json worktree:return script entry pointing at a deleted file

## Approved (Awaiting Merge)

PRs that passed review and are queued for Champion auto-merge (`loom:pr`).

_None._
